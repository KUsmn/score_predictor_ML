Score predictor algorithm using supervised machine learning
Data has only one feature (hours studied) that would determine the function model i.e. score
Model trained using tensorflow and keras optimizers
Program prompts the user to enter number of hours and returns the predicted score
Plots the optimized function along with the data points to visualize accuracy
The repo contains two files, one contains just the source code and the other is a notebook
