# 🎯 Student Score Predictor using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a simple **supervised machine learning model**  
built using **TensorFlow and Keras** to predict student scores based on  
hours studied. It applies **linear regression** from scratch using  
low-level TensorFlow APIs, making it both educational and customizable.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Uses one feature: **Hours Studied**  
- Trains a **linear regression model** to predict **Student Score**  
- Implements cost function and training loop manually using TensorFlow  
- Prompts user input for prediction  
- Visualizes learned regression line over data  

---

## 🔧 Installation

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
```

---

## 🚀 Run the Script

1. Update the dataset path in `score_predictor.py`:
```python
student_data = pd.read_csv("path/to/student_scores.csv")
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python score_predictor.py
```

3. Enter the number of hours studied (e.g., `5.5`) when prompted.

---

## 🔢 Example Output

```
Enter number of hours studied to predict the student score: 6
The student is predicted to score 61.8 by studying 6.0 hours
```

A plot will also be displayed showing:
- Scatter plot of actual data points  
- Learned regression line showing predicted scores  

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains 25 records with:

- `Hours` (float): Number of hours studied  
- `Scores` (float): Marks scored by the student
